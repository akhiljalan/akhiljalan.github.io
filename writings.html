<h3>Emergentism and Computational Limits to Knowledge (Nov 15 2023)</h3>
<p>Nov 15 2023.</p>

<p><i>In this note, I will argue that computational complexity theory has implications for the philosophy of science, specifically for ideas related to emergence and reductionism. In particular, I claim that if a property of a system is computationally irreducible in a certain sense, then it is arguably “emergent,” and specifically “weakly computationally emergent.”</i></p>
