<h2> Ongoing Research: Protein Interaction Inference via Graph Transfer Learning </h2>


Protein interaction networks are crucial tools for understanding the interaction of a cell line with candidate growth factors and recombinant proteins in a culture. However, network data are missing or incomplete for many cell lines of interest. Therefore, we augment protein interaction data using <em>graph transfer learning</em> algorithms. These algorithms leverage information about protein interaction networks for better-studied cell lines to infer interactions for the true cell line of interest.

In the figure, we show an example comparing 300 nodes in the protein interaction networks of both <em>homo sapiens</em> and <em>bos taurus</em> (cattle). The STRING functional protein database contains dense information about the interactions of these 300 proteins for both species; therefore, we can ``align'' the algorithm to learn differences in those regions, and then infer interactions in less-understood parts of the <em>bos taurus</em> proteome.

In addition to learning from the differences in network data, algorithms should leverage prior knowledge of the differences between species so as to not overfit proteomic data. A promising approach is to use phylogenetic tree distance as a starting point for the transfer learner. In technical terms, phylogenetic information can parametrize a Bayesian prior for the distribution shift between the proteomes of different species.

<h2> Short Article: A Small-Data Approach to Machine Learning in Cellular Agriculture </h2>

Mega-scale machine learning algorithms such as ChatGPT and AlphaFold are well known to the public. But these algorithms require millions of data points to train, while cellular agriculture practitioners would be lucky to have a few hundred for any particular task. Moreover, such data may come from heterogeneous sources, have missing fields, and be subject to observational noise. In this short article written for the CMMC, I argue that a different class of machine learning techniques, drawing on active learning and sequential optimization, can nevertheless have a huge impact on cellular agriculture. Indeed, they already have, and I cite several academic publications to this effect.
