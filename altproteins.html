<h2> Short Article: A Small-Data Approach to Machine Learning in Cellular Agriculture </h2>

Mega-scale machine learning algorithms such as ChatGPT and AlphaFold are well known to the public. But these algorithms require millions of data points to train, while cellular agriculture practitioners would be lucky to have a few hundred for any particular task. Moreover, such data may come from heterogeneous sources, have missing fields, and be subject to observational noise. In this short article written for the CMMC, I argue that a different class of machine learning techniques, drawing on active learning and sequential optimization, can nevertheless have a huge impact on cellular agriculture. Indeed, they already have, and I cite several academic publications to this effect.
