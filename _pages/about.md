I am a first-year PhD student at UT Austin, broadly interested in theoretical computer science and mathematics. 

I did my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics in UC Berkeley, where I was fortunate to be advised by Nikhil Srivastava. My thesis studied the invariant factors of the critical groups (or "sandpile groups") of certain graphs, such as expander graphs.
